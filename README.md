# YugiohCardDeck

# Description
Do you believe in the heart of the cards?

Yu­Gi­Oh! Deck Browser uses the YugiohPrices.com API. It's a simple deck browser app for a specific card deck.

The app itself has:
a navbar component
a component that lists all cards from the deck along with their type;
a component that displays the selected card's details
a shared services folder
The app is implemented by using Angular7 and SCSS

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.2.
